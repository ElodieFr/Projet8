**Objectives:**

Deliver an oral presentation of a modeling approach to an internal or external client.
Conduct a technology watch on tools and trends in data science and AI (either in NLP or Computer Vision).
Create a dashboard to present the modeling work to an audience.
Write a methodological note to communicate the modeling approach.

**Context:**

**Context 1: DASHBOARD**
Prêt à dépenser, a financial company specializing in consumer credit for underbanked or unbanked individuals, is facing a major transparency challenge with its clients. Although the credit scoring tool in place is effective for assessing borrowers’ creditworthiness, its decision-making process lacks clarity. Faced with increasing demands for explanations from clients, Prêt à dépenser aims to develop an interactive dashboard for client advisors. This tool will help visualize and clearly explain the factors that influenced the granting or rejection of a loan, thus fostering better understanding and acceptance of decisions by clients. This initiative aligns with the company's values of transparency and closeness with its customer base.

**Context 2: STATE OF THE ART**
In its ongoing effort to stay at the forefront of innovation in data science, Place de Marché, recognized for its expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image analysis, wants to explore new modeling techniques in these areas. The goal is to conduct a comprehensive comparative study between a recent approach and a traditional method already used within the company. This analysis will evaluate the performance of both techniques, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. The expected benefits are numerous: improved model accuracy, reduced processing time, optimized resources, etc. By proactively exploring new technologies, Place de Marché aims to maintain its technological edge and continue offering increasingly efficient and innovative data science solutions.
